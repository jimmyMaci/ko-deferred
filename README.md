# ko-deferred

A knockout extender that is using the $.Deferred from jquery so it depends on jquery.

Example is described in the blog:

https://smellegantcode.wordpress.com/2012/12/10/asynchronous-computed-observables-in-knockout-js/

And in the knockout wiki:

https://github.com/knockout/knockout/wiki/asynchronous-dependent-observables

This is intended to use only with computed observables not for pureComputed observables. 

If you want to use pureComputed observables take a look at this awesome project from @danielearwicker:
